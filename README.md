# NBA-Salaries-Machine-Learning
We set out to determine what players are over and underpaid using machine learning. The premise is, we use a machine learning algorithm to figure out how much a player should be making and compare that against their actual contract. The difference between these values determines how much the player is overpaid or underpaid. For this task, we’ll create 4 machine learning models to predict a player’s salary based on historical data. Note, this is not meant to be a predictive metric of how much a player’s next contract will be worth. This evaluates expected salary relative to real salary to see who’s overpaid and who’s underpaid.
